## Overview: 
This is a project on visualizing path finding algorithm i.e., Dikstraâ€™s algorithm.
This app is entirely built in React JS and below is the how the interface looks like.
Red box is the starting node and Blue box is the end node.
Here design of grid is done using tables and set first node and second node colors using CSS properties.


## Intro ..

Path finding algorithms plays a vital role in our daily life such as packets in computer networks , google maps uses a path finding algorthm to find the shortest path.
So this project main idea is to visualize this path finding algorthm using react with the help of some css animations.

Let's check out some intuition behind this algorithm for better insights.

### Dijkstra
- Dijkstra's Algorithm lets us prioritize which paths to explore. Instead of exploring all possible paths equally, it favors lower cost paths.
- We can assign lower cost to encourage moving on roads while assigning high cost on highway to avoid them.
- It is the algorithm of choice for finding the shortest path paths with multiple destinations.
Below is the demo
